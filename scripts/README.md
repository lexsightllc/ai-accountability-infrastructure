# Script Toolbelt

The executable scripts in this directory provide a consistent developer
experience across environments. Each task has a Bash implementation and a
PowerShell mirror. Domain-specific Python utilities are preserved under
`scripts/legacy/`.

Use `make <task>` or invoke `scripts/<task>` directly.
